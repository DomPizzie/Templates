VPN is used by all members to access the magic.

## Overview

The VPN is used to access certain resources.

The VPN utilizes a client and does allow split-tunneling (local network resources only) - Internet access is through the VPN tunnel. The additional connection hop slows downloads rather significantly, so it is recommended to utilize a virtual machine for access.
